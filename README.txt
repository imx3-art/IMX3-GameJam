About the Game
In Secret Zombies, you will control a zombie navigating through various levels, evading capture by stealthily avoiding humans. Use clever distractions by detaching your arms—or even those of your fellow zombies—to uncover secret codes. These codes will unlock gates that guide you closer to the legendary Zombie Heaven. Can you outsmart the humans and survive?

	Key Features
	Stealth-Based Gameplay: Hide, distract, and outmaneuver humans who are determined to capture you.

	Innovative Mechanics: Use your zombie abilities creatively to progress through the levels.

	Inspired Design: The game draws influence from Metal Gear Solid for stealth mechanics and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening for camera 	design and visual style.

Development
Built with Unity.
Available for web play on Itch.io.
